Let me be your air
Let me warm your body, free you
No inhibition, no fear

Is it like the ocean?
What devotion? Are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder, again

Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer, again
How deep is your love?

Open up my eyes and
Tell me who I am
Let me in on all your secrets
No inhibition, no sin




How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion? Are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?

Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer, again
